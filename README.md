# IHub_Reconciliation

# Reconciliation Application

This is a full-stack application for reconciling financial data from CSV files, detecting anomalies, and integrating with Jira for anomaly reporting. It consists of a React frontend and a Flask backend.

## Overview
- **Frontend:** A React-based UI for uploading CSV files and displaying reconciliation results in tabular format.
- **Backend:** A Flask API that processes CSV uploads, performs reconciliation, detects anomalies, and creates Jira issues for anomalies in the Catalyst Reconciliation tab.

## Prerequisites
- **Frontend:** Node.js (v16+), npm
- **Backend:** Python 3.8+, pip
- **Jira:** A Jira instance with API token for anomaly reporting (optional for IHub functionality).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
